> Open scoring.ipynb
> Run section Data Structures
> In section Baseline, manually insert query.
> Run section Baseline
> Run section Model (this will get the 10 first results from the model once it exists, not yet implemented)
> Run section Scoring
> Give each wine a result from 0 (doesn't fit to the query) to 3 (completely fits with the query), use exit to cancel the scoring (the results recorded for this query so far will be lost)
> Backup the scores.json every once in a while so nothing gets lost
