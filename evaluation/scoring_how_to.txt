> Open scoring.ipynb
> Run the setup section at the very top
> Run section Data Structures
> In section Baseline, manually insert query
> Run section Baseline
> Run section Model
> Make sure there is a total of 20 results generated, if not rerun Baseline and Model
> Run section Scoring
> Give each wine a result from 0 (doesn't fit to the query) to 3 (completely fits with the query), use exit to cancel the scoring (the results recorded for this query so far will be lost)
> Change the query again manually and repeat from there
> Backup the scores.json every once in a while so nothing gets lost
